# SAILORS

I have served for the past three years as a project mentor for the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab Outreach Summer (SAILORS) program, now known as AI4ALL Stanford (website: [ai-4-all.org](http://ai-4-all.org)).
This is a two week camp for 10th grade girls that exposes them to AI and its potential benefits.
As the only project mentor to serve all three years, I made important contributions to the program's early success and continuity.

Projects form the core of the AI4ALL curriculum.
With the help of another volunteer, I created the robotics project, which focuses on self-driving cars.
In this project, there are two core technical concepts that the girls learn and implement on small robots: a linear control system for following a "road" of tape with light sensors and dynamic programming (Dijkstra's algorithm) for optimally navigating a network of roads.
We also engage the students in discussions and lectures about the challenges associated with self-driving cars along with potential societal benefits and social justice impacts, such as providing mobility to people who can't drive and reducing the environmental and time cost of transportation.

I don't know what specific challenges these young women will face if they pursue a career in technology, but it is my hope that when they face obstacles, they will look back on AI4ALL and other experiences and know that they belong in the engineering community and that their work matters.
I and the other AI4ALL staff believe that both the concrete technical component and the more abstract material about impacts of technology are vital to this program because the connection between the two is key to inviting people into engineering.
I was delighted to find that one of my students, a daughter of immigrant parents from Mexico living in the agricultural town of Salinas, CA, summarized this connection between her code and its potential for good in a [blog post](https://medium.com/ai4allorg/bringing-inclusive-ai-into-my-community-df845386b83f):
"Through lines of code, I was able to create an algorithm that, when implemented in society, could actually change peopleâ€™s lives," she said.

The final project video from the first year of the program is shown below:

# Army High Performance Computing Summer Institute

I created a short 5 lecture course about decision making under uncertainty for the 2017 Army high performance computing summer institute. The code for the in-class demonstrations is below.
