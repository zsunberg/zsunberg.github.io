\section{Research}

\mycventry{October 2018 -- October 2019}{Hybrid Systems Laboratory}{University of California, Berkeley, CA}{
    \vspace{2pt}
    \cvline{Strategy alignment in differential games}{
        Developed particle filtering techniques to deal with the presence of multiple Nash equilibria in differential games and coordinate strategies with humans that robots interact with~\cite{peters2020alignment}.
    }
    \cvline{Analysis of online algorithms for continuous POMDPs}{
        Developed the first proof of convergence to optimality for an online sampling-based POMDP algorithm in continuous observation spaces~\cite{lim2020sparse}.
    }
    \cvline{Reachability-based safety constraints in partially observable domains}{
        Combining Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis with partial observability, focused on problems with human interaction; using POMDP planners to find optimized feedback policies that are aware of the reachability-based safety constraints.
    }
    \vspace{6pt}
}

\mycventry{2015 -- 2018}{Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL)}{Stanford University, Stanford, CA}{
    \vspace{2pt}
    \cvline{POMCPOW}{Proved analytically that leading online POMDP solvers converge to suboptimal solutions for problems with continuous observation spaces and proposed a new algorithm, partially observable Monte Carlo planning with observation widening (POMCPOW) as a solution \cite{sunberg2018pomcpow}.}
    \cvline{Behavior-aware decision making in self-driving cars}{Showed that modeling the internal states of other human drivers and approximately solving the resulting POMDP can simultaneously improve both safety and efficiency. In particular, a multiple-lane-change maneuver on a highway can be accomplished in about half the time while still maintaining the same levels of safety and comfort \cite{sunberg2017value}. Other students are currently collaborating with me to .}
    \cvline{Adaptive control with belief space MCTS}{Solved adaptive control problems (i.e. problems where some dynamics parameters are unknown) by modeling them as POMDPs and using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in the belief space. This approach achieved superior results in cases with large uncertainty \cite{slade2017simultaneous,slade2020estimation}.}
