\section{Research}

\mycventry{2015 -- present}{Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL)}{Stanford University, Stanford, CA}{
    \vspace{2pt}
    \cvline{POMCPOW}{Proved analytically that leading online POMDP solvers converge to suboptimal solutions for problems with continuous observation spaces and proposed a new algorithm, partially observable Monte Carlo planning with observation widening (POMCPOW) as a solution \cite{sunberg2018pomcpow}. Currently pursuing an analytical proof for the algorithm's optimality.}
    \cvline{Behavior-aware decision making in self-driving cars}{Showed that modeling the internal states of other human drivers and approximately solving the resulting POMDP can simultaneously improve both safety and efficiency. In particular, a multiple-lane-change maneuver on a highway can be accomplished in about half the time while still maintaining the same levels of safety and comfort \cite{sunberg2017value}. Currently exploring better models of human behavior.}
    \cvline{Adaptive control with belief space MCTS}{Solved adaptive control problems (i.e. problems where some dynamics parameters are unknown) by modeling them as POMDPs and using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in the belief space. This approach achieved superior results compared to a conventional approach in cases with large uncertainty \cite{slade2017simultaneous}. Currently testing different approximations to speed up the algorithm (it already operates in realtime for small problems) and comparing to more advanced alternatives.}
