\mycventry{October 2018 -- Present}{Hybrid Systems Laboratory}{University of California, Berkeley, CA}{
    \vspace{2pt}
    \cvline{Safety verification of control systems with visual sensors (DARPA Assured Autonomy)}{
        Developing techniques for guaranteeing the safety of a vehicle that uses a camera as a sensor, possibly with a convolutional-neural-network processing step. We hope to overcome some of the challenges of incorporating the visual sensor through careful design of the control and information filtering systems.
    }
    \cvline{Advanced algorithms for continuous POMDPs}{
        Developing algorithms based on DESPOT for problems with continuous observation spaces to overcome the shortcomings of POMCPOW (see below, \cite{sunberg2018pomcpow}) including a tendency to create shallow search trees and challenges with theoretical guarantees.
    }
    \cvline{Reachability-based safety constraints in partially observable domains}{
        Combining Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis with partial observability, focused on problems with human interaction; using POMDP planners to find optimized feedback policies that are aware of the reachability-based safety constraints.

\mycventry{2015 -- 2018}{Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL)}{Stanford University, Stanford, CA}{
    \vspace{2pt}
    \cvline{POMCPOW}{Proved analytically that leading online POMDP solvers converge to suboptimal solutions for problems with continuous observation spaces and proposed a new algorithm, partially observable Monte Carlo planning with observation widening (POMCPOW) as a solution \cite{sunberg2018pomcpow}.}
    \cvline{Behavior-aware decision making in self-driving cars}{Showed that modeling the internal states of other human drivers and approximately solving the resulting POMDP can simultaneously improve both safety and efficiency. In particular, a multiple-lane-change maneuver on a highway can be accomplished in about half the time while still maintaining the same levels of safety and comfort \cite{sunberg2017value}. Other students are currently collaborating with me to .}
    \cvline{Adaptive control with belief space MCTS}{Solved adaptive control problems (i.e. problems where some dynamics parameters are unknown) by modeling them as POMDPs and using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) in the belief space. This approach achieved superior results compared to a conventional approach in cases with large uncertainty \cite{slade2017simultaneous,slade2018estimation}.}
